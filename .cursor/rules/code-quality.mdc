Description:

1. Run Rspec after you are done with a feature or update.

2. Run RuboCop only after Rspec tests pass. There is no need to check Rubocop until all tests are passing.
   - Run Rubocop only on Ruby files (*.rb, *.rake):
   - Run: bundle exec rubocop [modified_files]
   - If errors exist, run: bundle exec rubocop -a [modified_files]
   - Verify all issues are fixed
   - Only proceed to testing after linting passes

2. Never skip linting checks - this is a mandatory step before any code can be considered complete.

3. Order of operations:
   a. Make code changes
   b. Run Rspec tests
   c. Run RuboCop
   d. Fix linting issues


4. Example usage:
   ```bash
   # After modifying files
   bundle exec rubocop app/models/user.rb
   # If errors found
   bundle exec rubocop -a app/models/user.rb
   # Verify fixes
   bundle exec rubocop app/models/user.rb
   ```

5. Common scenarios:
   - When editing multiple files
   - When creating new files
   - When modifying existing

6. Both Rspec and Rubocop are required to pass before commiting code.
