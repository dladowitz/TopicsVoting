# Device Detection Simplification

## Problem Solved

The previous screen size monitoring approach was causing form data to be cleared when users switched between browser tabs. This happened because:

1. The system constantly monitored screen width changes
2. Switching tabs could trigger false screen size changes
3. This caused unnecessary page reloads that cleared form data

## Solution: User Agent-Based Device Detection

### Key Changes

1. **Eliminated constant monitoring**: No more resize event listeners
2. **User agent detection**: Simple, reliable device type detection
3. **One-time setup**: Device type is detected once and stored in a cookie
4. **No more form clearing**: Eliminates the root cause of the issue

### Implementation

#### JavaScript Controller (`screen_size_controller.js`)
- Detects device type using user agent string
- Sets device type cookie (24-hour expiration)
- Only reloads if layout mismatch is detected
- Runs once on page load, not continuously

#### Ruby Concern (`screen_size_concern.rb`)
- Updated to use `device_type` cookie instead of `screen_width`
- Renamed `mobile_width?` to `mobile_device?` for clarity
- Simplified logic with no complex calculations

### Benefits

1. **No more form clearing**: Users can switch tabs without losing data
2. **Better performance**: No constant event monitoring
3. **More reliable**: User agent detection is more stable than screen size
4. **Simpler code**: Much easier to understand and maintain
5. **Better UX**: Seamless experience for users

### Device Detection Logic

The system detects mobile devices using this user agent pattern:
```javascript
/android|webos|iphone|ipad|ipod|blackberry|iemobile|opera mini/i
```

This covers:
- Android devices
- iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod)
- BlackBerry devices
- Windows Mobile devices
- Opera Mini

### Cookie Management

- **Name**: `device_type`
- **Values**: `mobile` or `laptop`
- **Expiration**: 24 hours
- **Path**: `/` (site-wide)

### Testing

The solution includes comprehensive tests for:
- Desktop device detection
- Mobile device detection (iOS, Android)
- Layout detection and matching
- Cookie management

## Migration Notes

- Old `screen_width` cookies will be ignored
- New `device_type` cookies will be set automatically
- No user action required
- Backward compatible with existing layouts

## Files Modified

1. `app/javascript/controllers/screen_size_controller.js` - Simplified device detection
2. `app/controllers/concerns/screen_size_concern.rb` - Updated to use device type
3. `spec/javascript/controllers/screen_size_controller_spec.js` - Test coverage

This approach is much simpler, more reliable, and completely eliminates the form auto-clear issue while maintaining the responsive layout functionality.
