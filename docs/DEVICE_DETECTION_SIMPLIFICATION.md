# Device Detection Simplification

## Problem Solved

The previous screen size monitoring approach was causing form data to be cleared when users switched between browser tabs. This happened because:

1. The system constantly monitored screen width changes
2. Switching tabs could trigger false screen size changes
3. This caused unnecessary page reloads that cleared form data

## Solution: User Agent-Based Device Detection (No Reloads)

### Key Changes

1. **Eliminated constant monitoring**: No more resize event listeners
2. **User agent detection**: Simple, reliable device type detection
3. **One-time setup**: Device type is detected once and stored in a cookie
4. **No page reloads**: Layout switching happens server-side on next page load
5. **Complete form preservation**: No more form data clearing

### Implementation

#### JavaScript Controller (`screen_size_controller.js`)
- Detects device type using user agent string
- Sets device type cookie (24-hour expiration)
- **No page reloads** - layout switching is handled server-side
- Runs once on page load, not continuously
- Checks if device type is already set to avoid redundant operations

#### Ruby Concern (`screen_size_concern.rb`)
- Updated to use `device_type` cookie instead of `screen_width`
- Renamed `mobile_width?` to `mobile_device?` for clarity
- Simplified logic with no complex calculations

### Benefits

1. **No more form clearing**: Users can switch tabs without losing data
2. **Better performance**: No constant event monitoring
3. **More reliable**: User agent detection is more stable than screen size
4. **Simpler code**: Much easier to understand and maintain
5. **Better UX**: Seamless experience for users
6. **No page reloads**: Layout switching happens naturally on navigation

### Device Detection Logic

The system detects mobile devices using this user agent pattern:
```javascript
/android|webos|iphone|ipad|ipod|blackberry|iemobile|opera mini/i
```

This covers:
- Android devices
- iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod)
- BlackBerry devices
- Windows Mobile devices
- Opera Mini

### Cookie Management

- **Name**: `device_type`
- **Values**: `mobile` or `laptop`
- **Expiration**: 24 hours
- **Path**: `/` (site-wide)
- **Set once**: Only set if not already present

### Layout Switching

- **Server-side**: Layout is determined by the Ruby concern based on the cookie
- **No client-side reloads**: Page reloads are completely eliminated
- **Natural navigation**: Layout switches happen when users navigate to new pages
- **Form preservation**: No interruption to user input

### Testing

The solution includes comprehensive tests for:
- Desktop device detection
- Mobile device detection (iOS, Android)
- Cookie management and persistence
- No page reload behavior

## Migration Notes

- Old `screen_width` cookies will be ignored
- New `device_type` cookies will be set automatically
- No user action required
- Backward compatible with existing layouts
- No page reloads during device detection

## Files Modified

1. `app/javascript/controllers/screen_size_controller.js` - Simplified device detection (no reloads)
2. `app/controllers/concerns/screen_size_concern.rb` - Updated to use device type
3. `spec/javascript/controllers/screen_size_controller_spec.js` - Test coverage
4. `app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.haml` - Updated method reference

## How It Works

1. **First visit**: Device type is detected and stored in cookie
2. **Subsequent visits**: Server uses the cookie to determine layout
3. **Tab switching**: No reloads, no form clearing
4. **Navigation**: Layout switches happen naturally on page changes

This approach is much simpler, more reliable, and completely eliminates the form auto-clear issue while maintaining responsive layout functionality.
